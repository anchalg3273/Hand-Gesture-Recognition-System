# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-System
In this innovative Python project, I’ve developed a virtual mouse system that empowers users to control their computers through intuitive hand gestures. Leveraging computer vision techniques, the system detects and tracks the user’s hand in real-time. Algorithms intelligently recognize specific gestures (such as swipes, clicks, and scrolls) to simulate mouse actions. The project harnesses the power of OpenCV for image processing and NumPy for efficient feature extraction.
